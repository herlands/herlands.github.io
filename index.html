	<p class="lead">Hi, I’m William. Most days I struggle with statistics and computers. But when I get the chance, I'll hike, travel, study Talmud, and embroil myself in politics.</p>
	<p>Currently I am a PhD student in a dual program in Machine Learning and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on developing scalable Bayesian nonparametric methods for multidimensional modeling and prediction. These methods are particularly suited for analyzing complex data arising from human behavior, while still providing clear and interpretable results. Additionally I study machine learning approaches for causal inference and econometrics.</p>
    <!--My advisor, Daniel Neill, runs the  <a href="http://epdlab.heinz.cmu.edu/">Event Pattern Detection Lab</a> and I collaborate with a number of the members and alumni of the EPD lab.-->
    
    <p>Using the methods I develop, I collaborate with Project Tycho and various American cities to study dynamics of diseases, crime, and transportation in the United States. Ultimately, my research is oriented towards helping policy makers create more targeted and effective policy interventions. Through better analytics and clearer communication between researchers and policy makers I believe we can make government smarter, smaller, and more just.</p>
    
    <p>I grew up in New York City and studied electrical engineering at Princeton University, graduating in 2012. For three years in college I conducted research in Paul Prucnal’s Lightwave Communications Research Lab where I developed a love for the joy and travails of scientific research. I worked at MIT Lincoln Laboratory conducting research on artificial intelligence, robotics, and cybersecurity for the Department of Defense. There, I lead a project developing wireless attacks and counterdefenses for robotic swarms in collaboration with the Distributed Robotics Laboratory.</p>
