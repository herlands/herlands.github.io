	<p class="lead">I'm William! Most days I struggle with statistics and computers. But when I get the chance, I'll hike, travel, study gemara, and embroil myself in political arguments.</p>
	<p>Currently I am a PhD student in a dual program in Machine Learning and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. My advisor, Daniel Neill, runs the <a href="http://epdlab.heinz.cmu.edu/">Event Pattern Detection Lab</a>.</p>
