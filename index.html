	<p class="lead">This website is now depricated. Please visit williamherlands.com for my currently maintained website.</p>
	<p>I research machine learning and statistics focussing on public policy and public health. I hold a dual PhD in Machine Learning and Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University where I was advised by Daniel Neill and Andrew Gordon Wilson.</p>
    
    <p>From a methods perspective I develop novel ways to automate and generalize econometric tools. Specifically, I use anomalous pattern detection to identify natural experiments for causal inference in observational data. Additionally, using Bayesian nonparametrics and deep learning I develop spatiotemporal models to characterize and predict nuanced real-world phenomena.</p>
    
    <p>Applying these methods I study dynamics of disease, crime, and transportation specifically within urban environments where strong spatiotemporal correlations require careful methodological consideration.</p>
		
	<p>Ultimately, my research is oriented towards helping policy-makers create more targeted and effective interventions. Through better analytics and clearer communication I believe we can make government smarter, fairer, and more responsive.</p>

    
    <p>I grew up in New York City and studied electrical engineering at Princeton, graduating in 2012. For three years in college I conducted research in Paul Prucnalâ€™s <a href="http://ee.princeton.edu/research/prucnal/">Lightwave Communications Research Lab</a> where I developed a love for the joy and travails of scientific research. Afterwards, I worked at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a> conducting research on AI, robotics, and cybersecurity.
